## Example

This example is actually mostly what I have in [libmc](https://github.com/MiguelCastillo/generator-libmc) yo generator for scaffolding my projects.

You need a `Gruntfile.js`, which you load all the task config files in the `tasks` directory.  Take a look at the tasks for some examples.
